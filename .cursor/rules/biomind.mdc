# BIOMIND Project Rules

This is a **Next.js static export** game (no backend, no Docker). Only the following conventions from the project cursor rules apply.

## Language and documentation

- All documentation, code, and comments must be written in **English**.

## Git

- Use **conventional commits** (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).
- Write descriptive commit messages.
- Use feature branches for new features.
- **Do not commit before being asked to.**

## TypeScript and React

- Use **TypeScript interfaces** for component props (e.g. `interface BoardProps { ... }`).
- Use **functional components** with hooks.
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components; camelCase for functions, variables, and hooks (e.g. `useGameState`).
- Prefer named exports for components; default export only for pages.
- Use path alias `@/` for imports (e.g. `@/lib/gameLogic`, `@/components/Board`).

## Code quality

- Run `npm run lint` before committing.
- Run `npm run format` to fix formatting (Prettier) when available.
- Follow established patterns in the codebase.
